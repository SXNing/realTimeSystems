Real Time Systems:

INF: 
1. Iterative Network Flow algorithm to check if a given input set is schedulable or not.
2. This is a kind of Static Scheduling with no priorities.

Scheduling Algorithms:
1. EDF - Earliest Deadline First is a dynamic priority driven scheduling algorithm
2. RM  - Rate Monotonic is a fixed priority driven scheduling algorithm
3. TDA - Time demand analysis to check if a set is schedulable by RM if U < 1.
